## Introduction
This project involved the design and implementation of a software switch using DPDK (Data Plane Development Kit) that is configurable with 
P4 (Programming Protocol-Independent Packet Processors).

## Methods
Our Integrated solution is comprised of two main stages:

A packet classifier that can be configured in real-time. The classifier is being loaded to the system in real-time using P4. The classifier assigns a Quality of Service (QoS) value to each packet.

Buffer-overflow management algorithm, Implemented in the NIC’s DPDK driver  (depends on the free buffer space and the packet’s  QoS).
Default algorithm – Every packet passes.
Three Buffers Round Robin – The buffer is split into three sub-buffers for handling packets with different priorities, and each sub-buffer is served in a round-robin manner.
Inverse Linear algorithm – Packets pass \ dropped deterministically (QoS threshold).
Probabilistic Algorithm – Packets are passes \ dropped based on a probability model:

## Results
We collected data of the total QoS passed through the switch and performed a competitive analysis of the different algorithms.
From our results we obtained, we observe a clear improvement of the default packet forwarding procedure in a high-stress network state.
Also, The switch can support different communication protocols, which can be configured in real-time

## Installation
  1. clone
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/guy-davidi/p4_project
  ```
  2. run installtion scripts
```
chmod 755 ./scripts/p4cinstall.sh
./scripts/p4c_install.sh
chmod 755 ./scripts/dpdk_install.sh
./scripts/dpdk_install.sh
```
  3. Build DPDK's Pipeline APP
```cd /home/user/dpdk/examples/pipeline
mkdir build
make
```
  4. DPDK's uses NICs, Bind DPDK driver to device
```
cd /home/user/dpdk/usertools
sudo ./dpdk-devbind.py -b vfio-pci 0000:01:00.0
sudo ./dpdk-devbind.py -b vfio-pci 0000:05:00.0
```
  5. Compilation l2fwd.P4 -> l2fwd.spec (which DPDK's pipeline uses)
```
p4c-dpdk --arch psa l2fwd.p4 -o l2fwd.spec 
```
  6. In order run l2fwd (example)
```
sudo su
cd  ~/p4_project
sudo ./dpdk-pipeline -c 0x3 -- -s l2fwd.cli
```
  7. Connecting CLI DPDK-Pipeline APP
```
telnet 0.0.0.0 8086
pipeline PIPELINE0 stats
```
  8. In order to add table entries last must be call to 'commit'
     Note that Class Of Service is given to a packet in addition to egress port.
```
pipeline PIPELINE0 stats
pipeline PIPELINE0 table ipv4_host add ipv4_host_table.txt
pipeline PIPELINE0 commit
pipeline PIPELINE0 table ipv4_host show
Table ipv4_host: key size 4 bytes, key offset 16, key mask [ffffffff], action data size 4 bytes
match 0x0A000000 action send port 0x1 class 1
match 0x0B652B58 action send port 0x0 class 2
Table ipv4_host currently has 2 entries.
```
  9. Showing the stats of the pipeline - output
```
Input ports:
        Port 0: packets 877005976 bytes 52620358560 empty 14523130228
        Port 1: packets 625173214 bytes 37510392840 empty 14774963007

Output ports:
        Port 0: packets 0 bytes 0 clone 0 clonerr 0
        Port 1: packets 48986172 bytes 2939170320 clone 0 clonerr 0
        DROP: packets 1453193035 bytes 66846879610 clone 0 clonerr 0

Tables:
        Table ipv4_host:
                Hit (packets): 48986184
                Miss (packets): 1453193035
                Action NoAction (packets): 1453193035
                Action send (packets): 48986184
                Action drop_1 (packets): 0
```
  10. Read QoS from DPDK-App CLI
```
pipeline PIPELINE0 regrd reg_counter_0 0
```
  11. Run worker process:
```
cd worker
gcc worker.c -o worker
./worker
```
  12. Run Traffic from Ixia by ixexplorer Ixia application.

It can be seen that each sample has exact jump of 5 packets with QoS -> "17" that gave in the match action table!
## Wrtting QoS to hdr.ipv4.src_addr = class
